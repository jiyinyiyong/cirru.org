### Why Cirru?

Cirru Project helps people code in syntax tree. It offers a tree editor and a text syntax.

Cirru prefers indentations.
Symbols simplify parsing, indentations improves readability.

### What is Cirru?

"Cirru" came from `cirrus cloud`, and reads like `cirrus`(but without `s`).

The core of Cirru's text form is a indentation-based syntax:

* prefix syntax, see Lisp
* `()` to create expressions inside each line
* indentation with 2 spaces
* represent token with optional `""` and `\`, see Bash
* `$` as a function to fold code, see Haskell
* `,` as a function to unfold code, see CoffeeScript

Cirru adopted Lisp's notions to keep minimalistic:

* Syntax represents AST
* Code is data

### Examples

These snippets are identical although folding in various ways:

```cirru
set a (add (number 1) (numer 2))
```

```cirru
set a $ add (number 1) $ number 2
```

```cirru
set a $ add
  number 1
  number 2
```

```cirru
set a
  add
    number 1
    number 2
```

Also here's identical demos for `,` on unfolding:

```cirru
print
  + 1 2
  , 11
```

```cirru
print (+ 1 2) 11
```

And multi-level indentations is OK for `let` syntax:

```cirru
let
    a 1
    b 2
  + a b
```

```cirru
let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b)
```
